            <div>I'm a student of Chico State's class of 2024 now pursuing my Master's in Computer Science having received my Bachelors. I was first introduced to programming when I was a Senior in high school. Not knowing what direction I wanted to take my college career, I decided to take an introductory course in Python programming. Right then I knew that I wanted to learn more about Computer Science. Since then I have learned C++/C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, ML/AI, Web Development, Cybersecurity and more. 
                <br><br>These days I'm working hard to become a full-stack developer. This website is a minor testament to that progress. Aside from programming, I enjoy learning guitar and listening to new music styles. I hope to someday build an awesome guitar collection and produce my own music. I'm also a huge fan of motorsports - especially F1.</div>

                        This program was developed for my Spring 2024 Capstone project. The goal behind the development of a CPU emulator was to learn more about computer architecture methodologies including instruction encoding, decoding, execution, and memory management. RISC-V was chosen as the architecture of study due to its open-source design and rise in popularity in modern chip design.
